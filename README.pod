=head1 NAME

Asset::Pack - Easily pack assets into Perl Modules that can be fat-packed

=head1 VERSION

version 0.000001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use Asset::Pack;
    # lib/MyApp/Asset/FooJS.pm will embed assets/foo.js
    write_module('assets/foo.js','MyApp::Asset::FooJS','lib');
    # Or better still, this discovers them all and namespaces under MyApp::Asset
    find_and_pack('assets', 'MyApp::Asset");
    # It also writes MyApp::Asset which is an index file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to construct Perl modules containing the content of
arbitrary files, which may then be installed or fat-packed.

In most cases, this module is not what you want, and you should use a
C<File::ShareDir> based system instead, but C<File::ShareDir> based systems are
inherently not fat-pack friendly.

However, if you need embedded, single-file applications, aggregating not only
Perl Modules, but templates, JavaScript and CSS, this tool will make some of
your work easier.

If anything fails it throws an exception. This is meant for scripts that will be tended by
a human (or analyzed if it fails as part of a build).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<pack_index>

  pack_index($module, \%index) -> byte string

  pack_index("Foo::Index", { "Some::Name" => "foo.js" });

Creates the contents for an asset index

=head2 C<write_module>

  write_module($source, $module, $libdir)

  write_module("./foo.js", "Foo::Bar", "./")
  # ./Foo/Bar.pm now contains a uuencoded copy of foo.js

Given a source asset path, a module name and a library directory, packs the
source into a module named C<$module> and saves it in the right place relative
to C<$libdir>

See L</SYNOPSIS> and try it out!

=head2 C<write_index>

  write_index($index, $module, $libdir )

  write_index({ "A" => "X.js" }, "Foo::Bar", "./");

Creates a file index.
